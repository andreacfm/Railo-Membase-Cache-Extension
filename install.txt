
Unpack the  zip file somewhere onto your local file system 
e.g. under  c:/railix-x-x-x-xxx/ 

Start the  start.bat (Linux start.sh) in the  Railo directory

Now you can contact  the CMF data located under {railix}/webroot on the browser  (http:/localhost:8888) 
To stop  again use  {railix}/stop.bat, bzw. {railix}/stop.sh .
